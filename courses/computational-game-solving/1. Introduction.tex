\subparagraph{1 - Introduction}\label{introduction}

\textbf{Q:} Why study multi-step imperfect-information games?

\textbf{A:} Most real-world games are incomplete-information games with
sequential (or simultaneous) moves.

Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Negotiation
\item
  Multi-stage auctions
\item
  Sequential auctions of multiple items
\item
  Card games
\item
  etc.
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
Techniques for perfect-information games (ex. checkers, chess, and go)
don\textquotesingle t apply to incomplete-information games.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Why?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Private information
\item
  Need to understand signals and how other players will interpret
  signals
\item
  Need to understand deception
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{2 - Terminology}\label{terminology}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {\emph{Agent}} (or \emph{player})\\
  \strut \\
\item
  {\emph{Action}} (or \emph{move}) - choice that the agent can make at a
  point in the game.\\
  \strut \\
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {\emph{Strategy}} ({}) - mapping from history to actions.\\
  {}(to the extent the agent can distinguish a history)\\
  \strut \\
\item
  {\emph{Strategy set}} ({}) - strategies available to the agent.\\
  \strut \\
\item
  {\emph{Strategy profile}} ({}) - one strategy for each agent.\\
  \strut \\
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {\emph{Utility}} ({}) -\\
  Represents the motivations of the agents, maps outcomes to reals with
  the property that a higher number implies that outcome is more
  preferred.\\
  \strut \\
  \emph{Note} - Utility seems to be closely related to \emph{reward} in
  RL?\\
  \strut \\
  An agent\textquotesingle s utility is only determined after all
  agents, including nature, have chosen their strategy.\\
  \strut \\
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {\emph{Nature}} - pseudo agent that is used to model uncertainty.\\
  \emph{Note} - Nature seems to be closely related to \emph{environment}
  in RL.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{3 - Agenthood}\label{agenthood}

\begin{quote}
Agents seek to maximize their expected utility:\\
\strut \\
{}\strut \\
\strut \\
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Utility functions are scale-invariant.\\
  \strut \\
  \emph{Note} - We are only interested in the relative utility between
  strategies, so scaling them all by a linear transform does not change
  our rankings of actions.\\
  \strut \\
\item
  The utility function is up to the agent and can be used to model an
  agent\textquotesingle s risk attitude.

  \emph{Example:}\\
  Consider the two lotteries:\\
  Lottery 1 - 100\% chance of winning \$0.5M\\
  Lottery 2 - 50\% chance off winning \$1M

  The lotteries have equal expected values however agents may prefer one
  to the other depending on their willingness to take risk.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Often times, in game theory, only expected payoff or expected value
  (EV) is considered.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{4 - Game representations}\label{game-representations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {\emph{Extensive form}} - game tree form in which agents are nodes and
  their actions are edges.\\
  \strut \\
\item
  {\emph{Matrix form}} - Player 1\textquotesingle s strategy is along
  the rows, Player 2\textquotesingle s strategy is along the columns,
  each cell denotes the utility for each player given the action pair.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{5 - Dominant strategy
"equilibrium"}\label{dominant-strategy-equilibrium}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {\emph{Best response}} ({}) - {} .\\
  The strategy that yields the highest utility in response to the
  opposing player\textquotesingle s strategy, {} .\\
  \strut \\
\item
  {\emph{Dominant strategy}} ({}) - {} is the best response for all
  opponent strategies, {}\\
  The agent\textquotesingle s best strategy does not depend on its
  opponent\textquotesingle s strategy.\\
  \strut \\
\item
  {\emph{Dominant strategy "equilibrium"}} -\\
  Strategy profile in which each agent has chosen its dominant
  strategy.\\
  Therefore, no agent has motivation to change their strategy.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note} - dominant strategies don\textquotesingle t always exist.

\subparagraph{6 - Nash equilibrium}\label{nash-equilibrium}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {\emph{Nash equilibrium}} -\\
  No player has incentive to deviate from their strategy so long as
  their opponents do not deviate either. For every agent {}, {}\\
  \strut \\
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
Nash equilibrium is a subset of the dominant strategy equilibrium.
Dominant strategy equilibrium holds for all opponent strategies;
whereas, Nash equilibrium only holds for a fixed opponent strategy.

\emph{i.e.} I don\textquotesingle t change if you don\textquotesingle t
change, and vice versa.
\end{quote}

\hfill\break

Nash equilibrium may not exist or be unique for all games. (ex. Battle
of the Sexes)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {\textbf{Theorem:}} \textbf{Existence of (pure-strategy) Nash
  equilibria}\\
  Any finite game, where each action node is alone in its information
  set is dominance solvable by backward induction.

  \emph{Note} - an agent is "alone in its information set" if at every
  point in the game, the agent knows what moves have been played so far.

  \textbf{Proof:} Multi-player minimax search
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{7 - Mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium
(rock-paper-scissors)}\label{mixed-strategy-nash-equilibrium-rock-paper-scissors}

\includegraphics[width=5.20833in,height=\textheight]{C:/Users/SBC98/Desktop/Misc/obsidian-vaults/root/rock-paper-scissors.jpg}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {\emph{Bayesian game}} - game in which players have incomplete
  information.\\
  In the case of rock-paper-scissors, the agents don\textquotesingle t
  have knowledge of the other\textquotesingle s move.\\
  \strut \\
\item
  {\emph{Bayes-Nash equilibrium}} - Nash equilibrium of a Bayesian
  game.\\
  A strategy profile that maximizes the \emph{expected} payoff for each
  player given their beliefs and strategies played by others.\\
  \strut \\
\item
  {\emph{Mixed strategy}} - the agent\textquotesingle s strategy is a
  weighted mixture of pure strategies.\\
  Rock-paper-scissors has a \emph{symmetric} mixed strategy Nash
  equilibrium where all the agents have the same strategy.\\
  \strut \\
\item
  Existence:\\
  {\textbf{Theorem:}} Every finite player, finite strategy game has at
  least one Nash equilibrium if we admit mixed-strategy equilibria as
  well as pure. {{[}1950-Nash{]}}.\\
  \strut \\
\item
  Complexity of finding a Nash equilibrium in a normal form game:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    2-player 0-sum: polytime with LP
  \item
    2-player games:

      {[}2006-Daskalakis{]}}
    \item
      NP-complete to find an approx. \emph{good} Nash equilibrium
      {{[}2008-Conitzer{]}}

  \item
    3-player games are FIXP-complete {{[}2007-Etessami{]}}
